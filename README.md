# TDD Commercial FED task

Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to complete this coding task. ðŸ™‚ 

## What is this for?

We'd like to see how you would build the design included in the '/design' folder of this repo using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and in particular: 

- That you write clean, structured, semantic html.
- Your approach to writing, and knowledge of CSS, including the use of modern features where appropriate.
- You have a strong attention to detail and can replicate designs.
- You can deliver a sound responsive experience across all device sizes from the design provided.
- Your work demonstrates efficiency and best practice, while keeping things simple where possible.

We don't want you to spend too much time to complete this - provide whatever you feel can represent your current FE skill-set within a reasonable effort.

## About the design

- The design is a gallery of 3 items. You are not required to write the functionality and may select a library to use, or you may find writing your own javascript will suffice. 
- You may or may not have access to Sketch. A basic "UI Kit" is also provided, together with images of the design. We don't expect complete pixel perfect spacing between elements but as mentioned above we are looking at attention to detail. 
- We use Vue JS - you may choose to use a js framework for this task to demonstrate your knowledge, however plain html/css/js is completely acceptable at this point
- You may use any bundler you see fit (I like parcel.js), or use static files. 

## One way you might complete this task
